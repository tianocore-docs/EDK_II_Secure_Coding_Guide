Please do not access (write or read) the buffer beyond the size field.\n#GENERAL.3: When code processes the untrusted data, it MUST avoid integer overflow. Please use addition instead of subtraction, use division instead of multiplication.\n#GENERAL.4: When code processes the untrusted data, it MUST avoid untrusted data overlap with the trusted region.\n#GENERAL.5: When code processes the untrusted data, it MUST check the untrusted data in all possible paths.\n#GENERAL.INPUT.1: The code MUST check for valid input and reject everything else\n#GENERAL.INPUT.2: The code MUST perform sanity checks and bounds checks, such as check type, length, range, format.\n#GENERAL.INPUT.3: The code MUST use canonical representation. Always use fully qualified pathnames for files that get opened\n#GENERAL.INPUT.4: The code MUST beware of character encoding and watch out for escape characters if using a shell script\n#GENERAL.INPUT.5: The code MUST validate as much and as deep as possible to prevent unintentional errors if the code is changed; balance against coding time/performance.\n#GENERAL.INPUT.6: The code MUST be careful of boundary conditions (e.g., off by one error, array indices) and conditionals (e.g., reverse logic)\n#GENERAL.BUFFER.1: The code MUST check buffer sizes, copies, and indices (esp. sizeof)\n#GENERAL.BUFFER.2: The code MUST check for appropriate buffer size. Maximums should be defined globally where possible to avoid assumptions in lower code layers.\n#GENERAL.BUFFER.3: The code MUST check for NULL Pointers dereferenced in the code.\n#GENERAL.BUFFER.4: The code MUST check NULL for NIL-terminate strings.\n#GENERAL.ARITH.1: The code MUST check based on data type limitations (e.g., integer underflows and overflows).\n#GENERAL.ARITH.2: The code MUST properly cast numeric variables involved in string manipulation.\n#GENERAL.ARITH.3: The code SHOULD use SafeInt library to handle integer of external input.\n#GENERAL.FAIL.1: Once the check fails, the code MUST fail secure – fail closed.\n#GENERAL.FAIL.2: Once the check fails, the code MUST not provide hints to hackers (e.g., by disclosing information on failure). Don’t help an attacker with ‘guiding’ error messages.\nASSERT \n#ASSERT.1: ASSERT MUST be used for something that NEVER occurs. If something MIGHT occur, use ERROR HANDLING, please. Check function return values in a consumed API.

The threat model discussed here is a general guide and serves as the baseline of the EDK II firmware. For each specific feature in EDK II firmware, there might be additional feature-based threat models in addition to the general threat model.\nIn UEFI Threat Model, we discussed the asset, threat and mitigation. Here we will revisit these items and based upon STRIDE).\n\n\n\nThreat\nDesired Property\n\n\n\n\nSpoofing\nAuthentication\n\n\nTampering\nIntegrity\n\n\nRepudiation\nNon-Repudiation\n\n\nInformation Disclosure\nConfidentiality\n\n\nDenial of Service\nAvailability\n\n\nElevation of Privilege\nAuthorization\n\n\n\nIn EDK II firmware, the denial of service can be temporary in the current boot, or permanent in which case the system never boot again. The latter is more serious and it is named as permanent denial of service (PDoS).\nWe will consider the below adversary for the EDK II firmware:\n\n\n\nAdversary\nCapability\n\n\n\n\nNetwork Attacker\nThe attacker may connect to the system by network in order to eavesdrop, intercept, masquerade, or modify the network packet.\n\n\nUnprivileged Software Attacker\nThe attacker may run ring-3 software in an OS application layer. The attacker may perform a software based side channel attack (such as using cache timing).\n\n\nSystem Software Attacker\nThe attacker may run ring-0 software in the OS kernel or hypervisor, or run 3rd party firmware code in firmware boot phase. The attacker may perform the software based side channel attack (such as using cache timing, performance counters, branch information, or power status).\n\n\nSimple Hardware Attacker\nThe attacker may touch the platform hardware (such as power button or jumper) and attach/remove a simple malicious device (such as hardware debugger, PCI Leach to the external port, PCIE card to the PCIE slot, memory DIMM, NIC cable, hard drive, keyboard, USB device, Bluetooth device). The attacker may hijack the simple system bus (such as the SPI bus or I2C bus).\n\n\nSkilled Hardware Attacker\nThe attacker may hijack the complex system bus (such as memory bus, or PCI express bus). The attacker may perform the hardware based side channel attack, such as power analysis, thermal analysis, or electromagnetic analysis. The attacker may perform a glitch attack.\n\n\n\nWe will consider the below mitigations for the EDKII firmware:\n\n\n\nMitigation\nObjective\n\n\n\n\nProtection\nThe mitigation is to prevent such an attack for damaging the system.\n\n\nDetection\nThe mitigation is to detect if the system is under attack.\n\n\nRecovery\nThe mitigation is to recover the system if it is under attack.\n\n\n\n\nAsset: Flash Content\nAsset: Boot Flow\nAsset: S3 Resume\nAsset: Management Mode\nAsset: Build Tool\n\n"},"appendix_threat_model_for_edk_ii/asset_flash_content.html":{"url":"appendix_threat_model_for_edk_ii/asset_flash_content.html","title":"Asset: Flash Content","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

NIST SP 800-193 provides platform firmware resiliency guidelines. It extends protection to 3 principles: protection, detection, and recovery. It also enlarges the scope from system firmware (BIOS) to all the firmware on the platform.\nThe flash content here includes both firmware code (such as PEI, DXE, SMM etc) and firmware data (such as UEFI variables, Microcode, etc).\n\n\n\nThreat\nExample\n\n\n\n\nSpoofing\nN/A\n\n\nTampering\nIf the firmware is not protected or locked, the attacker might modify the firmware directly.If the firmware update process is not authenticated, the attacker might send a malicious firmware update image for update.\n\n\nRepudiation\nN/A\n\n\nInformation Disclosure\nIf the system software stores the secret in the firmware, the attacker may read the firmware content and get the secret.\n\n\nDenial of Service\nIf the attacker can modify the firmware content (code or data) and cause the firmware crash, the system might no longer boot. It becomes a permanent denial of service.\n\n\nElevation of Privilege\nIf the attacker can modify the firmware content (code or data) and store a Trojan in firmware, the Trojan may hide itself and gain the higher privilege.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdversary\nExample\n\n\n\n\nNetwork Attacker\nIf the network is enabled before SMM lock and flash lock, the attacker may send mal-formed network packets.\n\n\nUnprivileged Software Attacker\nThe attacker may trigger a firmware update, or write the UEFI variable.\n\n\nSystem Software Attacker\nThe attacker may access a silicon register to unlock the flash access register.The attacker may create a race condition to break the flash write protection or flash update authentication.\n\n\nSimple Hardware Attacker\nThe attacker may press the power button during flash update or recovery, or set a jumper to modify the system boot mode from normal boot to recovery or even manufacturing mode.The attacker may attach PCI Leach to perform DMA attack during flash update or recovery.The attacker may hijack the SPI bus to read or write to the chip data.\n\n\nSkilled Hardware Attacker\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMitigation\nExample\n\n\n\n\nProtection\nFor the code region, the flash write protection must always be applied. During the flash update, the new firmware image must be authenticated and the version must be checked to prevent a rollback attack. In order to mitigate Time-of-check/Time-of-use (TOC/TOU) attacks, the new image must be copied to a secure environment before the check. The DMA protection must be enabled during flash update.For the data region, the UEFI authenticated variable write must happen in an isolated execution environment. The authenticated variable data must be authenticated and the rollback protection must be applied. Just as in code region protection, in order to mitigate TOC/TOU attack, new variable content must be copied to a secure environment before the check and DMA protection must be applied to this environment. In addition, the secret must not be saved to the firmware code or data region.\n\n\nDetection\nThe detection happens in the next boot.For the code region, the industry may have different solutions to make sure the initial boot code is unmodified, such as Project Cerberus, Intel® Boot Guard, etc.For the data region, the UEFI variable driver needs to detect if the variable region is modified without using UEFI variable services.\n\n\nRecovery\nIf something wrong is detected, the entity which detects the failure needs to start the recovery process, and the recovery data must be in a known good and secure configuration and be delivered from a trusted and always available source.\n\n\n\n"},"appendix_threat_model_for_edk_ii/asset_boot_flow.html":{"url":"appendix_threat_model_for_edk_ii/asset_boot_flow.html","title":"Asset: Boot Flow","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

Because the firmware is almost the first component running on the system, another responsibility of the system firmware is to maintain the secure boot chain (defined in UEFI specification) and the trusted boot chain (defined by TCG).\nHere the secure boot chain means that the first entity needs to verify if the second entity is good before running it, not run the second entity if the verification fails. The trusted boot chain means that the first entity needs to measure the second entity before running it and then always run the second entity. The attestation may happen later. The system firmware needs to maintain both boot flows carefully. The verification and measurement must not be bypassed.\nIn addition, the system firmware may need to authenticate the end user, to determine if the user is authorized to perform some action. For example, the user may be asked to input a hard driver password to continue the boot. Or the user may be asked to input an administrator password to enter a setup page. Those actions must not be bypassed as well.\n\n\n\nThreat\nExample\n\n\n\n\nSpoofing\nIf the firmware needs to authenticate the user, the attacker may spoof the identity, or bypass the authentication check.\n\n\nTampering\nThe attacker may want to modify the secure boot logic or trusted boot logic (either code or configuration data) to bypass the verification or measurement.\n\n\nRepudiation\nN/A\n\n\nInformation Disclosure\nThe user identity and device password are secret information. The attacker may want to steal them.\n\n\nDenial of Service\nThe attacker may modify the secure boot configuration data to cause a system crash during verification.\n\n\nElevation of Privilege\nIf the attacker bypasses the user authentication, he or she may enter firmware setup page to modify the configuration.If the attacker bypasses the secure boot verification, he or she may run the unauthorized 3rd part code in the ring-0 environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdversary\nExample\n\n\n\n\nNetwork Attacker\nThe attacker may send malformed network packets to inject code into the system.The attacker may send a bad UEFI image to bypass or break the secure boot logic.\n\n\nUnprivileged Software Attacker\nThe attacker may write a malformed UEFI authenticated variable to break the secure boot configuration.\n\n\nSystem Software Attacker\nThe attacker may send a command to the isolated execution environment in order to modify the secure boot configuration.The attacker may enable a side channel to get secrets from memory.\n\n\nSimple Hardware Attacker\nThe attacker may attach PCI Leach to perform DMA attack to read the secret from memory, or write the code region to bypass the verification.\n\n\nSkilled Hardware Attacker\nThe attacker may hijack the memory bus to read secrets from memory, or write the code region to bypass the verification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMitigation\nExample\n\n\n\n\nProtection\nDo check for untrusted external input before use (such as network packet, option ROM, OS loader, and UEFI authenticated variable). Do not run any untrusted 3rd part code before verification.If the secret is generated, it must be cleared after use (such as temporary input from HII). If the secret needs to be stored, the choice includes: to save secret to hardware directly (such as OPAL password), to save hash plus salt to a UEFI variable (such as user password), to save the secret in an isolated environment (such as TPM MOR2). Side channel prevention must be applied in this case.DMA protection must be enabled. Memory encryption must be used if the memory bus attack is in scope.\n\n\nDetection\nN/A\n\n\nRecovery\nN/A\n\n\n\n"},"appendix_threat_model_for_edk_ii/asset_s3_resume.html":{"url":"appendix_threat_model_for_edk_ii/asset_s3_resume.html","title":"Asset: S3 Resume","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

It is not impossible.\nThis is not a traditional attack to the final system, but it represents an attack to the tool chain in the build environment.\nThe mitigation is: only trust the tool chain from a trusted source with the source code, and protect the tool chain in the build environment.\n"},"references.html":{"url":"references.html","title":"References","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
